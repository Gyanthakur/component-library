## Description

This PR adds comprehensive internationalization support to the component library, enabling multi-language capabilities for a global audience. The implementation includes support for English, Spanish, and French out of the box, with an extensible architecture for adding more languages.

### Type of Change

- [x] **Feature**: Added internationalization support
- [x] **Documentation**: Added comprehensive i18n documentation
- [x] **Enhancement**: Improved accessibility for global users

## Implementation Details

   - Spanish (es)
   - French (fr)

2. **Language Switcher Component**
   - Dropdown UI for language selection
   - Persistent language preference
   - Automatic language detection

3. **Translation System**
   - Context-based translation management
   - Custom translation hook for components
   - Utility functions for common translation patterns

4. **Comprehensive Translations**

   - Button text and call-to-action messages

### Files Created

- **Configuration**: `next-i18next.config.js`, updated `next.config.mjs`
- **Context**: `src/app/context/I18nContext.jsx`
- **Components**: `src/app/components/LanguageSwitcher.jsx`
- **Hooks**: `src/app/hooks/useTranslation.js`
- **Utilities**: `src/app/utils/translations.js`
- **Translations**: JSON files for en, es, and fr languages
- **Documentation**: `I18N_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `I18N_SUMMARY.md`

### Files Modified

- `src/app/layout.js` - Added I18nProvider
- `src/app/pages/Navbar.jsx` - Added language switcher
- `src/app/components/feedback/Alert.jsx` - Added translation for dismiss button
- `src/app/page.js` - Added comprehensive translations throughout homepage

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested:

- [x] Language switching works correctly
- [x] All text elements translate properly
- [x] Language preference persists across sessions
- [x] Automatic language detection functions
- [x] UI components display translated content
- [x] Fallback to default language when translation missing
- [x] Graceful handling of translation errors

## Checklist

- [x] Added internationalization support for 3 languages
- [x] Created language switcher component
- [x] Implemented translation context and hooks
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation
- [x] Updated existing components to use translations
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility
- [x] Followed React and Next.js best practices
- [x] Tested all functionality thoroughly

## Backward Compatibility

This PR maintains full backward compatibility. All existing functionality remains unchanged, with translations only applied when the i18n system is used. Components without translation support continue to work exactly as before.

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Languages**: Support for more languages based on community demand
2. **Dynamic Imports**: Load translation files on demand for better performance
3. **Translation Management**: Integration with translation management platforms
4. **RTL Support**: Right-to-left language support for languages like Arabic
5. **Pluralization**: Advanced pluralization support for different languages
